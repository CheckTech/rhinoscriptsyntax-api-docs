# PlaneFromFrame

Construct a plane from a point, and two vectors in the plane.
          

### Parameters:

- ***origin*** = A 3D point identifying the origin of the plane.
- ***x_axis*** = A non-zero 3D vector in the plane that determines the X axis
         direction.
- ***y_axis*** = A non-zero 3D vector not parallel to x_axis that is used
         to determine the Y axis direction. Note, y_axis does not
         have to be perpendicular to x_axis.
        

### Returns:


The plane if successful.
