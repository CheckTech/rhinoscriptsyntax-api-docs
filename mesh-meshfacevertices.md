# MeshFaceVertices

Returns the vertex indices of all faces of a mesh object
        Paramters:
          object_id = identifier of a mesh object
        Returns:
          A list containing tuples of 4 numbers that define the vertex indices for
          each face of the mesh. Both quad and triangle faces are returned. If the
          third and fourth vertex indices are identical, the face is a triangle.
